# 🏥 Health Symptom Checker — IBM SkillsBuild AI & Cloud Internship Project
This project is a conversational AI solution developed during the IBM SkillsBuild (AI & Cloud) Internship. It combines IBM Watson Assistant with a custom Flask backend API to help users describe their symptoms in natural language and receive relevant first-level health advice. The system also includes optional Twilio WhatsApp + Flex integration for live agent escalation.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The Health Symptom Checker is an interactive AI tool that interprets user symptoms and delivers context-aware advice. It relies on IBM Watson Assistant to handle the conversational flow and a Flask-based backend service to dynamically retrieve responses from a structured symptom dataset. For cases requiring human involvement, the system supports escalation to a live agent using Twilio Flex.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Natural Language Understanding** to interpret symptoms described in everyday language.
- **Dynamic Responses** generated by querying a backend symptom–advice dataset.
- **Custom Flask Backend API** handling real-time search and structured JSON responses.
- **Live Agent Escalation (Optional)** through Twilio WhatsApp + Flex.
- **Free-Tier Deployment** supported across IBM Cloud, Render, and Twilio Sandbox.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
The system consists of three main components working together:

1. **IBM Watson Assistant**  
   - Frontend conversational interface  
   - Handles intent detection, entity parsing, context maintenance  
   - Triggers backend API calls to fetch advice  

2. **Flask Backend API**  
   - Receives symptom queries from Watson Assistant  
   - Searches through a predefined dictionary of symptoms and advice  
   - Returns structured JSON responses  

3. **Twilio WhatsApp + Flex (Optional)**  
   - Provides live agent escalation  
   - Watson triggers a `connect_to_agent` signal  
   - Twilio handles routing to a human support agent  

Architecture Flow:  
User → Watson Assistant → Flask API → Advice Response  
(Optional) → Twilio Flex → Human Agent

- **Agent Handoff:** Twilio WhatsApp + Flex  
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## ⚙️ System Setup

### 1. Watson Assistant Setup
- Create a Watson Assistant instance using the **Actions** skill.
- Define intents for symptoms such as fever, headache, stomach pain, etc.
- Add actions to handle each intent and connect them to the backend.
- Configure API calls from Watson Assistant to the Flask backend.
- Map backend response fields to assistant messages.

### 2. Flask Backend (API)
- Lightweight Flask app deployed on Render.
- Exposes an endpoint to accept POST requests from Watson Assistant.
- Searches symptom dictionary and sends back structured JSON response.
- Deployed logs visible through the Render dashboard.

### 3. Twilio WhatsApp + Flex Integration (Optional)
- Use Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp (no official approval required).
- Implement a Flex flow for agent routing.
- Watson Assistant triggers a `connect_to_agent` action to start escalation.
- User messages shift to WhatsApp agent interface when needed.

## 🧪 Sample Queries and Responses
The system handles natural-language symptom descriptions.

**Example 1:**  
User: “I have a headache and fever.”  
Bot: Provides relevant advice (hydration, rest, monitor fever, etc.)

**Example 2:**  
User: “I feel chest tightness.”  
Bot: Advises immediate escalation depending on severity.

**Live Agent Example:**  
User: “I want to talk to a person.”  
Bot: Triggers Twilio escalation → Connects to agent.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- The system uses a **static dataset**, not a real medical diagnostic engine.
- No long-term patient history or personalized medical record tracking.
- Requires internet and proper cloud service availability.
- Twilio escalation fully depends on correct Flow and Flex setup.
- Not meant for emergency scenarios or professional healthcare decisions.

---

## 🧩 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how conversational AI, cloud services, and backend search logic can be combined to build a scalable health support system. By leveraging IBM Watson Assistant, Flask APIs, and optional Twilio integration, this project serves as a practical template for student projects, prototypes, or low-cost health advisory bots.
